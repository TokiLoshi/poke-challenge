# About this project

I'm taking Three.js journey course and decided to participate in this month's challenge, which is pokebal themed. While I'm still early on in my three.js journey I decided to submit my project to both keep me accountable to a deadline, and to share my progress on this journey. It was great practice adding textures and importing a model, which were kindly provided as open source and I've linked them below. I found the haunted house class in the three.js journey course really informed what I was trying to do with this project and used a lot of the techniques introduced there. I tried to dynamically add reads and rocks to the scene and practice grouping geometries with the trees. In doing this I ran into some issues with objects with geometries colliding, which was also interesting practice and raised a lot of questions about performance that I know I'll need to look into in the future.

## Things I would like to improve

As a stretch feature I wanted to create a custom 3D model of bees and flowers and add them to the scene but I ran out of time. This is something I'm looking to add to in the future as I think it would be fun and great practice.

I would like to improve the use of shadows, I struggled to get shadows to show up on the page and the shadows and lighting are something I think would really have contributed to making the scen feel more immersive and realistic.

I would also like to experiment with different animations, being able to create the illusiont that the water was moving would have been a nice addition.
